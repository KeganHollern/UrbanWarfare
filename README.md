Urban Warfare
=============

Urban Warfare is a fork of the Battle Royale: Ghost Hotel Project. It is being developed
by the original author of Ghost Hotel, Kegan "Ryan" Hollern. It is a last man standing
game mode. Players are thrown into a random city of altis and told to one thing.

Kill, or be Killed.

Search the nearby buildings for weapons and gear and stay within the ever shrinking circle
to be crowned victorious. Your stats are tracked allowing you to compete with friends to 
see who outperforms others in each of the following categories:

- Wins
- Kills
- Winrate
- Longest Kill
- Play Time

As I continue to work hard on this project you can expect it tobe able to support:

- Any Map (ArmA or Modded)
- Any Mod (Weapons, Vehicles, ACE, ect.)
- Linux Players (1.42 client)
- Linux Servers (all server extensions will have a linux counterpart)

You can also expect me to release "leaderboard" web files to allow server owners the option
to host a public leaderboard on their own websites.
